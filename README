CSU eInvoice:

A simple servlet written in groovy/java that receives electronic invoices via http and processes those in CSU's financial system (KFS).

To build the war:
ant all

To run:
Drop the created war into Tomcat/Jetty/etc.

To test:
Use the Unix curl command to post a valid cXML:

For example, using the xml file 'STAPLES_sample_invoice.xml' located at / (root) the command would be:
curl -k --verbose --request POST --header "Content-Type: text/xml" --data @/STAPLES_sample_invoice.xml http://localhost:8080/upload/
